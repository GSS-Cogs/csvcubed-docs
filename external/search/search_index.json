The csvcubed project provides libraries and utilities which make it easier to turn a CSV into 5-star linked data . By publishing 5-star linked data and leveraging open standards for data, we believe that we can help ensure that statistical data is discoverable, comparable and analysable by automated tools. We hope that this standards-based approach will unlock network effects which accelerate data analysis by making it easier to collate, compare and contrast data from different sources. How do I get started? See the quick-start guide . I want to know more csvcubed outputs data cubes using the CSV on the web (CSV-W) file format. These CSV-W files contain your statistical data with the metadata necessary to describe what the data means, in context.

This could be for a number of reasons such as invalid or failed measurements, suppression to avoid disclosing sensitive data, or because circumstances wouldn't permit an observation. csvcubed permits missing observation values as long as there is an attribute column which explains why the value is missing. The attribute column must be based on the http://purl.org/linked-data/sdmx/2009/attribute#obsStatus attribute. The observation which is missing must have the observation status filled in. Blank values are represented as a zero length string in an observation column in csv format (i.e. ,, ). A worked example: Sweden in Eurovision In the example below, which is an extract of a data set capturing Sweden's Eurovision entries, we see a Marker column which is used to explain why a the given row's observed value is missing. For example: the number of People on the stage is known for Anna Bergendahl's entry into Eurovision as she comepted in second semi-final; however as she didn't make it to the final, her Final Points, and Final Rank are not applicable and therefore the observations are blank in the associated csv. in the case of The Mama's entry in 2020, the entire contest was cancelled so no values are provided however they were to represent Sweden at Eurovision that year. It is important to note that the Marker column is based on the existing http://purl.org/linked-data/sdmx/2009/attribute#obsStatus attribute; this is vital to ensure that csvcubed knows that the attribute describes the status of the observation.

It is the most flexible approach as it allows you to vary measures and units within the same cube, but it is also the most verbose shape. the pivoted approach - a terser shape currently only compatible with data sets containing a single measure . These two shapes share a number of similarities in how they require data to be structured; this is explored in the following section on the common structure . Common Structure Both data shapes expect that data is structured as per the following example: Data set representing the number of 'Arthur's Bakes' stores in UK cities from 2020 to 2022 Year Location Value Status 2022 London 35 Provisional 2021 Cardiff 26 Final 2020 Edinburgh 90 Final 2021 Belfast 0 Final Note that : The table has a flat and tidy header row. No attempt has been made to group headers or bring any identifying characteristics such as the year into the headers. Each identifying characteristic has its own dimension column. the Year and Location dimension columns define the subset of the population that the row's observed value covers, i.e. each row describes the number of Arthur's Bakes stores in a particular UK city in a given year. Every row has an observed values column containing the measured value of some property. the Value column holds the observed values here. Each piece of information describing the observed value has its own attribute column. the Status attribute column contains information describing the state of the observed value itself. Note that attributes should only describe the observed value and must not identify any subset of the population. Standard shape The standard shape extends the common structure by requiring that each row has a measures column and a units column; these columns define the measure and unit (of measure) for each row. In our example, the measure observed is Number of 'Arthur's Bakes' and the corresponding unit is Count . Year Location Value Status Measure Unit 2022 London 35 Provisional Number of 'Arthur's Bakes' Count 2021 Cardiff 26 Final Number of 'Arthur's Bakes' Count 2020 Edinburgh 90 Final Number of 'Arthur's Bakes' Count 2021 Belfast 0 Final Number of 'Arthur's Bakes' Count The simplest qube-config.json we can define for this data set is: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 { \"$schema\" : \"http://purl.org/csv-cubed/qube-config/v1.0\" , \"title\" : \"'Arthur's Bakes' stores in UK cities from 2020 to 2022\" , \"description\" : \"The number of 'Arthurs' Bakes' stores in cities across the UK between 2020 and 2022.\" , \"creator\" : \"HM Revenue & Customs\" , \"publisher\" : \"HM Revenue & Customs\" , \"columns\" : { \"Year\" : { \"type\" : \"dimension\" }, \"Location\" : { \"type\" : \"dimension\" }, \"Value\" : { \"type\" : \"observations\" }, \"Status\" : { \"type\" : \"attribute\" }, \"Measure\" : { \"type\" : \"measures\" }, \"Unit\" : { \"type\" : \"units\" } } } It is possible to use the configuration by convention approach to generate a valid standard shape cube without defining a qube-config.json at all. Just ensure that your columns use the conventional column names appropriate to their type. Multiple Measures One of the benefits of the standard shape is that it is relatively straightforward to add new measure types and unit types; all that you have to do is add additional rows to your data set with the appropriate units and measures present. We can extend our example data set so that it now includes revenue values for the given year by adding rows to the table: Year Location Value Status Measure Unit 2022 London 35 Provisional Number of 'Arthur's Bakes' Count 2022 London 25 Provisional Revenue GBP Sterling, Millions 2021 Cardiff 26 Final Number of 'Arthur's Bakes' Count 2021 Cardiff 18 Final Revenue GBP Sterling, Millions The same data could be more naturally represented in the equivalent pivoted shape: Year Location Number of 'Arthur's Bakes' Revenue (GBP Sterling, Millions) 2022 London 35 25 2021 Cardiff 26 18 csvcubed does not currently support data sets containing multiple measures in the pivoted shape . Converting to the standard shape Since csvcubed doesn't currently support multi-measure data sets in the pivoted shape , it is often necessary to convert your data from the pivoted shape into the standard shape .

This makes it as quick as possible to get from data to CSV-W cube, but it doesn't always leave you with the best representation of your code list's metadata, structure, hierarchy, or values. In order to provide more accurate representations of code lists, csvcubed allows users to explicitly configure code lists using JSON. This guide details how to explicitly define a code list using csvcubed. Experience of writing basic JSON documents is assumed throughout this document. See this tutorial from DigitalOcean for an introduction to writing JSON. Defining a code list configuration file This approach allows defining a code list in a code list configuration file . The following example demonstrates the structure of a code list configuration file : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 { \"$schema\" : \"https://purl.org/csv-cubed/code-list-config/v1\" , \"title\" : \"Biscuit Varieties\" , \"summary\" : \"Common biscuit varieties.\" , \"description\" : \"A code list of common generic biscuit varieties available in supermarkets across the UK.\" , \"creator\" : \"http://statistics.data.gov.uk\" , \"publisher\" : \"http://statistics.data.gov.uk\" , \"dataset_issued\" : \"3000-01-01T00:00:00Z\" , \"dataset_modified\" : \"3000-01-01T00:00:00Z\" , \"license\" : \"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\" , \"themes\" : [ \"http://example.com/themes/biscuits\" ], \"keywords\" : [ \"Biscuits\" , \"Tasty\" ], \"sort\" : { \"by\" : \"label\" , \"method\" : \"ascending\" }, \"concepts\" : [ { \"label\" : \"Bourbon\" , \"description\" : \"The common chocolate bourbon biscuit.\" , \"notation\" : \"BB\" }, { \"label\" : \"Custard Cream\" , \"description\" : \"The custard flavoured sandwich biscuit.\" , \"notation\" : \"CC\" }, { \"label\" : \"Digestive\" , \"description\" : \"The ever trusty digestive biscuit.\" , \"notation\" : \"DG\" , \"sort_order\" : 0 , \"children\" : [ { \"label\" : \"Milk Chocolate Digestive\" , \"description\" : \"The milk chocolate digestive biscuit.

Concepts This section is used to define and describe the concepts in a code list. Metadata The following metadata can be defined in the metadata section of the code list configuration file : field name description default value title Title of the code list none description Description of the contents in code list none summary Summary of the contents in code list none creator Link to the creator of the code list none publisher Link to the publisher of the code list none dataset_issued Code list issued date/time none dataset_modified Code list modified date/time none license Link to the license of the code list none themes List or a single link of the theme(s) covered by the code list none keywords List or a single string of the keywords(s) covered by the Code list none sort Sort by ( label or notation ) and sort method ( ascending or descending ) of the code list by ( label ), method ( ascending ) Using sort The sort field allows defining the sort by and sort method fields of the code list. The sort by allows defining the field used by the sorting mechanism for sorting the concepts in a code list. This field can be the concept's label or the notation . The sort method allows defining whether the sorting needs to be done in ascending or descending order. If the sort field is defined, the concepts without the sort_order (see below) will be sorted according to the sort by and sort method . The remaining concepts which has the sort_order field defined will be sorted according to the sort_order field within each concept. Concepts The following fields can be defined for each of the concept defined in the concepts section: field name description default value label Label of the concept none description Description of the concept none notation Notation of the concept none sort_order A numeric value defining the sort order of the concept none same_as A link to a concept defined elsewhere none children List of child concepts none Using sort_order The sort_order field allows sorting a code list on per concept basis. If both the aforementioned sort field and the concept's sort_order are defined, csvcubed first sorts the concepts with sort_order , and then sorts the rest of the concepts according to the sort field. In other words, the concept's sort_order field has priority over the code list's sort field. Using same_as The same_as field allows using a concept defined elsewhere in the internet (e.g. E92 concept in Geography Linked Data ). Referencing a code list configuration file This new code list can be referenced in a qube-config.json file using the code_list field in dimension configuration , e.g. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 { \"$schema\" : \"https://purl.org/csv-cubed/qube-config/v1\" , \"columns\" : { \"Biscuit Variety\" : { \"type\" : \"dimension\" , \"code_list\" : \"./biscuit-varieties.json\" } } } Defining an in-line code list It is also possible to define a code list configuration inside a qube-config.json file. This approach is recommended for defining simple code lists (e.g. code lists with a small number of concepts or simple hierarchy). 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 { \"$schema\" : \"https://purl.org/csv-cubed/qube-config/v1\" , \"title\" : \"Biscuit Weightings\" , \"summary\" : \"The average weights of different kinds of biscuits.\" , \"description\" : \"A data set containing the average weights of a series of different kinds of biscuits.

This makes it possible to generate a valid CSV-W cube without writing a qube-config.json at all. For an introduction to this topic, see the quick start on designing your CSV . Minimum requirements The configuration by conventional approach in csvcubed requires that: Your data set must be in the standard data shape . The data CSV's column titles use conventional column names for measure columns, unit columns and observed value columns. Adhering to the conventional column names is important since csvcubed uses those to understand what each column in your data set contains. Inferred configuration In order to generate a cube, csvcubed needs some additional metadata and makes a few inferences to ensure it has all of the information it needs: The title of the cube is the name of the csv file in title case with underscores or dashes replaced by spaces. Every column which does not use a conventional name is interpreted as a dimension . The title of each dimension is the title case version of the column header with any underscores or dashes replaced by spaces. A code list is generated for each dimension column. This code list is generated from the unique values present in the data CSV column. Observation values are decimal values. New measures are created using the unique values in the measures column unless a URI is present, where that uri is assumed to point to an existing measure. New units are created using the unique values in the units column unless a URI is present, where that uri is assumed to point to an existing unit.

Metadata A CSV-W file contains metadata which improves discoverability of data publications. In csvcubed, we use a selection of metadata entries from established namespaces to enable users to contribute to the web of data faster. The metadata fields available, their description and defaults are as follows. field name description default value title the title of the cube A capital case version of the csv file name description a description of the contents of the cube none publisher a link to the publisher of the cube none creator a link to the creator of the cube none keywords a list or a single string of the keywords(s) covered by the data (i.e. [\"trade\", \"energy\", \"imports\"] ) none See the describing your CSV quick start for a practical guide on configuring metadata. Column definitions A CSV-W file provides detailed information about the columns beyond their values. In csvcubed, we are targeting a level of detail which results in a data cube which can be be expressed using W3C's RDF Cube Vocabulary. A data cube must have a dimension, and observation columns along with at least one unit and measure defined to be valid. A cube may also have one or more attribute columns which provide clarification to observational data. Units and measures may be attached to the observation column (single measure cube), or appear in a column of their own (multi-measure cube). To define a column in a qube-config.json file, provide the column header's value as a dictionary key, and create a new dictionary. A column is assumed to be a dimension unless otherwise configured using the type key or the column being named one of the reserved names. A dimension can still have a \"type\": \"dimension\" key/value pair. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 { ... \"columns\" : { \"Example column\" : { \"type\" : \"dimension\" } } } If a column mapping is not defined in the qube-config.json file for a given CSV column, the column is configured using convention . Dimensions The dimension [column] serve[s] to identify the observations. A set of values for all the dimension components is sufficient to identify a single observation. Examples of dimensions include the time to which the observation applies, or a geographic region which the observation covers. Think of the principle of MECE . Measures The measure [column] represent[s] the phenomenon being observed. The measure column is effectively another form of dimension. Attributes The attribute [column] allow us to qualify and interpret the observed value(s). They enable specification of the units of measure, any scaling factors and metadata such as the status of the observation (e.g. estimated , provisional ). The attribute column can link to resources or literals. Units The unit component is a type of attribute column which provides the units of the observation. Observations The observation column are the numeric values of the observation being recorded in the data set. Using templates To use or extend an existing template, provide a \"from_template\": \"month\" key-value pair referencing one of the available templates . csvcubed loads the reference template's key-value pairs making creating linked data much faster. The values for a column with a from_template set in qube-config.json override the values for the template. In the example below, the CSV contains a column called Marker, the qube-config.json file references the template observation-status but csvcubed will override the template's label with the value provided. 1 2 3 4 5 6 \"columns\" { \"Marker\" : { \"from_template\" : \"observation-status\" , \"label\" : \"Data Marker\" } } Using existing columns To reuse or extend existing dimensions, attributes, units, or measures, provide a \"from_existing\": \"uri\" key-value pair linking to the RDF subject for the component specification. csvcubed determines whether the column is a reuse of an existing component (e.g. dimension) or requires the extension of an existing component through the configuration of the column. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 \"columns\" : { \"reused column\" : { \"type\" : \"dimension\" , \"from_existing\" : \"https://example.org/dimension/years\" }, \"reused and renamed column\" : { \"type\" : \"dimension\" , \"from_existing\" : \"https://example.org/dimension/flavours\" , \"label\" : \"ice cream flavours\" } } In the example above there are two reused dimensions. For the first existing dimension, \"reused column\" takes the existing dimension \"years\" and reuses it without any changes. The second dimension is an example of the creation of a new dimension but showing that ice-cream flavours it is a child dimension of flavours. Unless the component being reused is a literal attribute and you're providing a \"data_type\" key-value pair, any other key-value pairs provided will change the column to a new component which will extend the linked parent component. Shared column configuration options There are several configuration options available across column types except observations. field name description default value type The type of the column (Required) dimension label The title of the column (Optional) The capital case of the header in the csv file with spaces replacing underscores description A description of the contents of the column (Optional) none from_existing The uri of the resource for reuse/extension (Optional) none definition_uri A uri of a resource to show how the column is created/managed (i.e. a uri of a PDF explaining a list of units) (Optional) none The from_existing value when set provides the basis of linked data; it allows csvcubed to generate additional RDF-hints to allow users to discover how the tidy_data.csv links to other data semanticly.

Observation columns can have measures and units defined against them to obviate the need for separate unit and measure columns in a single unit/measure data set. field name description default value type The type of the column; to configure an observation column use the value observations . NOTE This value is required if the observation column isn't conventionally named or required if either measure or unit columns are not part of the observation csv file. diemsnion data_type The data type of the observations. This should generally be a decimal or integer. (Optional) decimal unit The unit for this observation column; this can a uri to an existing unit, or a dictionary containing a new or extended existing unit. If there is a unit column this value must not be provided. (Optional) none measure The measure for this observation column; this can be a uri to an existing dimension, or a dictionary containing a new or extneded existing measure. If there is a measure column this key must not be provided. (Optional) none Measure and Unit Columns Configuration Measure and unit columns are treated slightly differently to dimension, attribute, and observation columns. Measure and unit columns contain references to discrete units and measures. In both cases by defining \"type\": \"measure column\" or \"type\": \"unit column\" provides the same behaviour. Do not put measures in units columns and units and measure columns. field name f description default value type The type of the column, provide \"measure column\" for the measure column type or \"unit column\" for the unit column (Required) dimension values If basic units/measures are desired, a boolean value of true is used to signify to csvcubed to create units/measures from values of this column; otherwise values is a dictionary which defines the units/measures using the notion from Measures and Units true Measures and Units Measures can either be attached to a Measure Column if there are a mixture of measures in your data set, or to an Observation column if all observations in the cube have the same measure. Units can either be attached to a Unit Column if there are a mixture of units in your data set, or to an Observation column if all observations in the cube have the same unit. Measures Configuration Measures have no unique configuration options. field name description default value label The title of the measure (Required; Optional if from_existing defined) none description A description of the contents of the measure (Optional) none from_existing The uri of the resource for reuse/extension (Optional) none definition_uri A uri of a resource to show how the measure is created/managed (i.e. a uri of a PDF explaining the measure type) (Optional) none Units Configuration Units are effectively attributes with additional options. field name description default value label The title of the unit (Required; Optional if from_existing defined) none description A description of the contents of the unit (Optional) none from_existing The uri of the resource for reuse/extension (Optional) none definition_uri A uri of a resource to show how the unit is created/managed (i.e. a uri of a image which shows the formula on how the unit is derived) (Optional) none scaling_factor The scaling factor (expressed in base 10) is used to define a new unit from an existing base (i.e. \"GBP millions\" would have a form_existing unit of GBP, and a \"scaling_factor\": 1000000 ) (Optional) none si_scaling_factor The si_scaling_factor helps relate common scaled units to source SI units, for example kilograms are 1000 grams.

If you're not sure which unit is right for your data set, take a look at the guide on choosing units . Defining a new unit csvcubed automatically defines new units using the unique values in your standard shape cube's units column. If desired, you can gain more control over how the units are defined by providing configuration in a qube-config.json file. A data set like the one defined below can be paired with a JSON configuration allowing you to provide additional information about the units you are creating: Location Value Measure Unit Biscuitburgh 31 Annual Income (Gross Value Added) Pounds Sterling (\u00a3), Millions 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 { \"$schema\" : \"https://purl.org/csv-cubed/qube-config/v1.0\" , \"columns\" : { \"Unit\" : { \"type\" : \"units\" , \"values\" : [ { \"label\" : \"Pounds Sterling (\u00a3), Millions\" , \"description\" : \"Millions of Pounds Sterling (GBP, \u00a3).\" } ] } } } N.B. you must ensure that your units column definition contains defintions for all of the units contained within your dataset; the label property must match the value found in the cell. We can see in the above that we've defined a new unit called Pounds Sterling (\u00a3), Millions and been able to configure its description; this will give extra context to help people really understand your data. But we can still improve our data by describing how this new unit relates to standardised units defined by other organisations so users can compare your data with other data cubes with confidence. Linking a new unit to an existing unit In the above example we defined a new unit called Pounds Sterling (\u00a3), Millions . Looking at the guide on choosing units we see that we could relate this unit back to a well established standard unit defined by QUDT: PoundSterling . Our dataset could of course be expressed directly in PoundSterling but that may make the data harder to read and compare so it would be ideal if you could define your own new unit Pounds Sterling (\u00a3), Millions . We've done some checking on the QUDT Units vocabulary to make sure that our new unit doesn't duplicating an existing unit so we decide that it is helpful to link Pounds Sterling (\u00a3), Millions back to PoundSterling . This will ensure that software can automatically figure out how to compare our data with other data sets that use units related to PoundSterling .

How csvcubed interprets a CSV csvcubed needs to understand how your statistical data is structured in order to make it more machine readable. There are two ways that you can do this with csvcubed, we are covering the configuration by convention approach in this quick-start. Configuration by convention requires a standard CSV data shape with conventional column titles and fill it out with your data which is explained briefly below. Structuring your data The standard shape of data is the recommended way to shape your data for csvcubed. It requires that your CSV has the following columns: ...Identifying characteristics... Value Measure Unit ... 3.4 Length Feet ... 3.6 Length Feet In the above table: identifying characteristics are one or more columns which identify the sub-set of the population that has been observed in a given row. These are called dimensions elsewhere in documentation. the Value column contains the value which has been observed or measured; there is only ever one observed value per row in the standard shape . the Measure column describes what has been observed or measured; note that the measure should not include any information about the units of measure. the Unit column describes the unit of measure in which the Value has been recorded. The names of the columns is how csvcubed interprets what each column contains in the configuration by convention approach . Using the column titles Value , Measure and Unit or one of their synonyms in your CSV will work. All other columns are assumed to be identifying characteristics ( dimensions ). Adding your data First, we start by taking the above shape and adding columns for each of your identifying characteristics ( dimensions ). From hereonin we will be creating a data set to represent the competition winners in Eurovision.
